		<h2>Growing up</h2>
		<h4>My home town</h4>
		<p>I grew up in Rayton. A small town in South Africa. I fondly remember the days of cycling around town and climbing trees.</h4>

		<h4>Primary and secondary education</h4>
		<p> <ul> 
			<li>Rayton Primary school (1995-2001)</li>
			<li>Erasmus High School, Bronkhorstspruit (2002-2006)</li>
			</ul>
			My school days were filled with sport including netball, athletics, swimming, tennis and even some hockey. I was actively involved in the school newspaper, the Renaissance, and was editor for two years. I loved taking part and joined in with school concerts, writing competitions and debating - not that I was great at it.
